* Desing Choices

    + ### Index
    I choose the name Battersea Power Gym because I live in Battersea and making a website for a gym seemed adequate to me. Thinking of the Battersea Power Station, this made me reference to electricity, energy, power and tried to drop this in the image of the website.

    I choose this green colour for the logo and as leitmotiv to refer at the green colour from the batterie signal in the electronic devices. You can see on the index page a red button at the bottom, the offer in yellow in the middle and at the top the green colour in the logo and links for social networks, this tries to refer to the level of batteries. And when you go over the logo or click on it, it also turns green, meaning you will recharge your batteries with us, you will feel stronger. The background image was selected, because in addition to someone running in a gym, it has the green of the trees.

    I choose this kind of blue as the background colour in the Facilities section, to signify trust, loyalty, sincerity, confidence and stability. I put the most relevant facilities with icons and with a brief explanation, if you want more, you can click on the buttons. On footer text in the green colour of the gym, basic information, and background in black colour to contrast the letters.

    I tried not to show too much information at first sight, just the most important and necessary, clear and easy access, meaning confidence, style, dynamism and positive energy.

    + ### Sign
    Here I choose this picture to meaning empathy and common action: like everybody is happy joining to the gym or everybody is happy booking. About forms, the curvy shape and transparent padding it try to mean transparency, dynamism and style
